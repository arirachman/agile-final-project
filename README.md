# Agile Planning and Project Execution

## Introduction

This repository documents my learning journey with **Agile iterative planning**. Throughout the process, I gained hands-on experience with:

* Writing effective user stories
* Estimating and assigning story points
* Building and refining a product backlog
* Creating a sprint plan and executing it
* Managing daily workflows, including deciding which story to prioritize and keeping the team aligned
* Running daily stand-ups
* Using burndown charts to track progress and forecast outcomes
* Conducting sprint reviews and retrospectives
* Measuring success with actionable metrics to continuously improve team performance

## Learning Objectives

By working through this repository, I learned how to:

* Describe the sprint planning process
* Build and refine a backlog
* Define and write high-quality user stories
* Explain what a Kanban board is and how tasks flow across it
* Understand why iterative planning outperforms traditional up-front planning
* Recognize Scrum anti-patterns and evaluate team health
* Use metrics to assess and improve team performance
* Run different sprint meetings effectively
* Apply burndown charts to forecast sprint outcomes
* Manage the daily workflow, including stand-up meetings

## Lab: Agile Planning

This repository includes a lab focused on the learning objectives above, providing practical exercises for agile planning.

## Agile Final Project

This **capstone project** is a required component of the IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate for learners pursuing a practitioner track.

### Project Overview

For the final project, I created a complete Agile plan that included:

* Setting up a Kanban board
* Writing user stories
* Building and refining the product backlog
* Developing a sprint plan
* Tracking progress with a burndown chart
* Preparing for subsequent sprints

This project simulates a real sprint, allowing me to apply agile concepts in practice by moving stories across the Kanban board as they would progress in a real development cycle.

### Project Scenario

In this simulation, I took on the roles of **product owner, scrum master, and developer**:

* **Product Owner:** Created user stories and organized them into a backlog
* **Scrum Master:** Defined sprint milestones and ensured stories were ready for inclusion in a sprint
* **Developer:** Built the sprint backlog and executed tasks by moving them across the Kanban board

#### Use Case

Our teamâ€™s objective was to build the **back-end product catalog** for an e-commerce platform. Stakeholders required features such as:

* Creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting products
* Tracking product likes
* Deploying the application in a cloud environment with automated deployments

Using a **Kanban board**, we created the backlog, refined user stories, and developed sprint plans to deliver these capabilities.
